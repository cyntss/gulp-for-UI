# Gulp for UI
#### Gulp for creating an initial working environment for UI developers/designers

##### First, remember you need to have node.js, npm istalled. Here the link: https://nodejs.org/en/

All you have to do is:

```
Git clone git@github.com:cyntss/gulp-for-UI.git
```
We clone the repository locally in your computer
```
cd gulp-for-ui
```
We locate ourselves in the directory just created
```
npm install -g bower
```
We need Bower installed in our computer, and so we do.

```
npm install -g gulp
```
We install now Gulp, globally.

```
gulp
```
Run Gulp to start all the tasks

This will serve the website under localhost:8000, so just open a new browser and go to [localhost:8000](http://localhost:8000)

Found a problem? please open an issue :)
